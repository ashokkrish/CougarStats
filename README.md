# _CougarStats_: An R Shiny App for Statistical Data Analysis

## Overview

<img align="right" src="https://github.com/cwai097/COMP5690/blob/master/www/CougarStats.png" alt="rank" width="200" style="margin-top: 20px" />

**CougarStats** is an open-source platform-independent browser-based interface for statistical data analysis. 

You can use the app on our website: <https://www.cougarstats.ca/>

or using our backup on Shinyapp.io server by clicking <https://cougarstats.shinyapps.io/CougarStats/>

<!-- Alternatively you can send a pull request to download all the files in this repository and run the app by loading `global.R`, `ui.R`, and `server.R` and clicking `Run App`. Note that the ``CougarStats`` project is not on CRAN, just on github.

CougarStats has also been Dockerized. You can pull the Docker image <a href="https://hub.docker.com/repository/docker/mmyer/cougarstats/general">here</a> by running:

    docker pull mmyer/cougarstats:latest

then start the container:

    docker run -dp 127.0.0.1:3838:3838 mmyer/cougarstats

and navigate to 127.0.0.1:3838 using a browser of your choice to access a copy of CougarStats running locally on your machine.
